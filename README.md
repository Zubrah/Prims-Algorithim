# Prims-Algorithim
In this tutorial, you will learn how Prim's Algorithm works.

Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex
has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph


# How Prim's algorithm works
a) It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.

b) We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight until we reach our goal.

c) The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:

d) Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random.
e) Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the minimum and add it to the tree
f) Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree
